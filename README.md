# Project Week 1

## Planning

1. Exploring APIs we are interested in working with

- We loved animal APIs especially cats!
- [Cat-facts](https://alexwohlbruck.github.io/cat-facts/)
- [CATAAS-Cat as a service](https://cataas.com/#/)

2. Considering our user journey

- Once users arrive on our project page, they will be able to click a button to complete a form to request a photo of cat and a cat fact

3. Decide MVP and estimate it

- Create a page (markup and styling) – E2 (Jihye)
- Event function for buttons – E2 (Jihye)
- Get data (fetch) – E3 (Danilo)
- Present data (imgs and text) – E2 (Danilo)
- Responsive design (mobile-first) – E2 (Jihye)
- Check Accessibility – E1 (Danilo)

4. Set up repo and initialise our file structure

## User stories

### Core Stories

#### The users want to:

- input text, a filter and a tag to get a random picture of cat (E3)
- click a button to present a cat fact with a random picture of cat (E2)
- land a homepage and be able to click a button to use the service (E2)
- make sure the service is mobile-first design (E2)
- make sure the service is accessible for everyone (E1)

### Stretch stories

#### As a provider, I want to:

- present some indication that data is loading(E2)
- want to tell when somthing goes wrong(E2)

### Acceptance Criteria

- Query at least two APIs using fetch
- Dynamic content generated with JS
- A clearly defined user journey, docummented in your readme
- A responsive, mobile-first design
- Ensure your app is accessible to as many different users as possible
