Danilo and Ji's Cat project

# Project Week 1

---

## Planning

1. Exploring APIs we are interested in working with

- We loved animal APIs especially cats!
- [Cat facts API](https://catfact.ninja/)
- [CATAAS-Cat as a service](https://cataas.com/#/)

2. Considering our user journey

- Once users arrive on our project page, they will be able to click a button to complete a form to request a photo of cat and a cat fact

3. Decide MVP and estimate it

- Create a page (markup and styling) – E2 (Jihye)
- Event function for buttons – E2 (Jihye)
- Get data (fetch) – E3 (Danilo)
- Present data (imgs and text) – E2 (Danilo)
- Responsive design (mobile-first) – E2 (Jihye)
- Check Accessibility – E1 (Danilo)

4. Set up repo and initialise our file structure
